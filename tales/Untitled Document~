His parents weren't rich so he began to save his pocket money to be able to travel to the match. He also helped people on the street, went from house to house in change for a few coin.
For his greatest luck he reached exactly the amount he needed to travel to the match with his father.
After his team won he could celebrate with them as they heard how much he worked to collect the money to see their match and cheer for them.
His dream came true. He couldn't belive it. This day was the best day of his life. The father saw in his son's eye how happy he was and this made him as happy as his son. After this the kid caught a deadly disease and doctors said that the cure is really expensive. His favourite team paid for the cure but sadly it was too late and doctors couldn't save his life. The team attended the kid's funeral and gave him the title of their greatest fan.
